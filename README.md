# TLDV Conversation Extractor

A tool to extract clean conversation transcripts from TLDV HTML, available as both a web app and a Python script.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Try the web version: [TLDV Conversation Extractor](https://gschagas12.github.io/tldv-transcript-extractor/)
> Fork of [barshy/tldv-transcript-extractor-](https://github.com/barshy/tldv-transcript-extractor-), fixed for TLDV's current transcript layout (speaker name inside a `<button>`). See [sample-input-new-layout.html](sample-input-new-layout.html).

## 🎯 What It Does

This tool extracts clean, readable conversation transcripts from TLDV (The Long Distance Video) meeting recordings. It processes the HTML of a TLDV transcript and converts it into a simple text format with speaker names and their dialogue.

## 📋 Example Output

```
Speaker 1: Not at the moment. No. Yeah, that's
Speaker 2: It. Listen, listen. Now and Another another project too. Pretty cool. Eh
Speaker 1: Um, what are you talking about this page?
```

## 🌐 Web Version

### Features
- Works entirely in your browser - no data is sent to any server
- Privacy-focused: all processing happens locally
- Download the extracted conversation as a text file
- Copy the extracted conversation to clipboard
- No installation or dependencies required

### How to Use the Web Version
1. Visit [TLDV Conversation Extractor](https://gschagas12.github.io/tldv-transcript-extractor/)
2. Go to your TLDV transcript page
3. Right-click on the transcript container and select "Inspect Element"
4. Find the `<div id="transcript-container">` element
5. Right-click on it and select "Copy" → "Copy outerHTML"
6. Paste the copied HTML into the tool
7. Click "Extract Conversation" to process the transcript
8. Use the "Download" or "Copy to Clipboard" buttons as needed

### Sample Input

We've included a [sample-input.html](sample-input.html) file in this repository that shows the expected HTML structure from TLDV. The sample input would produce this output:

```
Speaker 1: Hello and welcome to our meeting.
Speaker 2: Thanks for having me here today.
Speaker 1: Let's discuss the project timeline.
```

This sample demonstrates the HTML structure that the tool is designed to parse. You can use it to test the tool or understand what kind of HTML to copy from TLDV.
